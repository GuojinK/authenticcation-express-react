Since I can't directly access external URLs, including GitHub repositories, I can suggest a general template for a README file that explains how to start a typical NodeJS project. You can customize it to fit your specific project details:

## Introduction
This project is built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and ReactJS. It includes basic authentication features, such as login, registration, and Google OAuth2 integration.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- PostgreSQL installed and running. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuojinK/authenticcation-express-react.git
cd authenticcation-express-react
```

Install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```

## Setting Up the Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and update it with your environment-specific settings:
```plaintext
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
SECRET_KEY="your_random_string_secret"
PORT="your_port"

```

## Running the Application

To start the backend server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To launch the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and run:

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
